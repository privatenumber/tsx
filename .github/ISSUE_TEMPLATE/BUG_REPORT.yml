        ## 📋 Minimal reproduction
        > ⚠️ If a **minimal** reproduction is not provided, **the issue will be closed.**

        The minimal reproduction proves a bug exists in this project, allows others to debug it for you, and streamlines resolution.

        <details>
          <summary><strong>How do I create a minimal reproduction?</strong></summary>

        1. Delete all unnecessary files and data. Keep it under 10 files.

            Delete irrelevant files (e.g. `LICENSE`, `.npmrc`, `.github`).
            Do you have unnecessary dependencies, scripts, properties in `package.json`?

        2. Delete all unnecessary code. Reduce the scope.

            Try to narrow the scope of the reproduction as much as possible.
            Is it a frontend or backend problem? Delete the other.
            Is it a TypeScript problem? Try converting to JavaScript to see if it still exists.
            Ideally, the code is reduced to a few lines of code in a single file.

        3. Set the `start` script in `package.json` to the command that demonstrates the bug.

        4. Verify the reproduction.

            Try running it yourself, and check:
            - Is the problem immediately reproducible?
            - Are dependencies properly declared?
            - Could I find more files or code that isn't necessary?

        5. Upload the reproduction to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), or a new GitHub repository, so it can be opened in the browser.

        The _smaller_ the reproduction, the _faster_ others can help you.
