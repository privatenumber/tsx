        Provide a _minimal_ reproduction in one of the following forms:
          1. A small code-snippet we can copy-paste <kbd>No dependencies allowed</kbd>
          2. Link to a repository with the command to run in the `package.json` script `start` <kbd>Dependencies allowed</kbd>
             Feel free to [fork this template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-huzszn?file=index.ts)
          3. Pull request with a failing test-case <kbd>No dependencies allowed</kbd>

        ‚ö†Ô∏è If a reproduction is not provided, the issue will be closed.
      
        üëâ **Tip:** The _smaller_ the reproduction, the _faster_ we can debug and resolve your issue.
        To save us debugging work, please eliminate all unnecessary code and dependencies to boil it down to bare minimums. This includes unnecessary files, dependencies, properties in `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.
