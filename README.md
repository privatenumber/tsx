## About
`tsx` is a CLI command you can use just like you would use `node`:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Before</th>
<th>After</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```sh
node file.js		
```

</td>
<td>

```sh
tsx file.js		
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


Use it to enhance your Node.js experience:
- _Just run_ TypeScript code without configuration
- Seamless integration between CommonJS and ES Modules

	You'll never get the following error again:

	```
	Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module <ESM package> from ./file.js not supported.
	Instead change the require of <ESM package> in ./file.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.
	```

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start
Try it out  without setup using [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx)! Just pass in a TypeScript file:

```sh
npx tsx ./script.ts
```

## Installation

### Local installation

To add tsx to an npm project as a development dependency:
```sh
npm install --save-dev tsx
```

You can reference it directly in the `package.json#scripts` object (you don't need `npx` here):
```json5
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "tsx ./file.ts"
    }
}
```

To use the binary, you can call it with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) while in the project directory:

```sh
npx tsx ...
```

### Global installation

If you want to use tsx anywhere on your computer without [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx), install it globally:

```sh
npm install --global tsx
```

Then, you can call `tsx` directly:

```sh
tsx file.ts
```

Now you can replace `node ...` with `tsx ...` in all your commands!

## Usage

### Swap `node` out for `tsx`

_tsx_ is an enhanced version of Node.js. If you have a `node ...` command, you can replace the `node` with `tsx` and it will just work.

Because it's a drop-in replacement for `node`, it supports all [Node.js command-line flags](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html).

```sh
# Old command
node --no-warnings --env-file=.env ./file.js

# New command
tsx --no-warnings --env-file=.env ./file.js
```

#### Custom `tsconfig.json` path
By default, `tsconfig.json` will be detected from the current working directory.

To set a custom path, use the `--tsconfig` flag:

```sh
tsx --tsconfig ./path/to/tsconfig.custom.json ./file.ts
```

Alternatively, use the `TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH` environment variable:

```sh
TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH=./path/to/tsconfig.custom.json tsx ./file.ts
```

### Watch mode
Run file and automatically rerun on changes:

```sh
tsx watch ./file.ts
```

All imported files are watched except from the following directories:
`node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor`, `dist`, and `.*` (hidden directories).

#### Ignore files from watch

To exclude files from being watched, pass in a path or glob to the `--ignore` flag:
```sh
tsx watch --ignore ./ignore-me.js --ignore ./ignore-me-too.js ./file.ts
```

#### Tips
- Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to manually rerun
- Pass in `--clear-screen=false` to disable clearing the screen on rerun

### REPL
Start a TypeScript REPL by running with no arguments:

```sh
tsx
```

### Cache
Modules transformations are cached in the system cache directory ([`TMPDIR`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPDIR)). Transforms are cached by content hash, so duplicate dependencies are not re-transformed.

Set the `--no-cache` flag to disable the cache:

```sh
tsx --no-cache ./file.ts
```

Alternatively, use the `TSX_DISABLE_CACHE` environment variable:

```sh
TSX_DISABLE_CACHE=1 tsx ./file.ts
```

### Node.js Loader

`tsx` is a standalone binary designed to be used in place of `node`, but sometimes you'll want to use `node` directly. For example, when adding TypeScript & ESM support to npm-installed binaries.

To use `tsx` as a  Node.js loader, pass it in to the [`--import`](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#enabling) flag. This will add TypeScript & ESM support for both Module and CommonJS contexts.

```sh
node --import tsx ./file.ts
```

Or as an environment variable:
```sh
NODE_OPTIONS='--import tsx' node ./file.ts
```

> **Note:** The loader is limited to adding support for loading TypeScript/ESM files. CLI features such as _watch mode_ or suppressing "experimental feature" warnings will not be available.

#### ESM only loader

If you only need to add TypeScript support in a Module context, you can use the ESM loader:

##### Node.js v20.6.0 and above
```sh
node --import tsx/esm ./file.ts
```

##### Node.js v20.5.1 and below

```sh
node --loader tsx/esm ./file.ts
```

#### CommonJS only loader
If you only need to add TypeScript & ESM support in a CommonJS context, you can use the CJS loader:

```sh
node --require tsx/cjs ./file.ts
```

### Hashbang

If you prefer to write scripts that doesn't need to be passed into tsx, you can declare it in the [hashbang](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang).

Simply add `#!/usr/bin/env tsx` at the top of your file:

_file.ts_
```ts
#!/usr/bin/env tsx

console.log('argv:', process.argv.slice(2))
```

And make the file executable:
```sh
chmod +x ./file.ts
```

Now, you can run the file without passing it into tsx:
```sh
$ ./file.ts hello
argv: [ 'hello' ]
```

If you prefer to use a local `tsx` instead of the global one, you can use `npx`:

_file.ts_
```ts
#!/usr/bin/env npx tsx

console.log('argv:', process.argv.slice(2))
```

### VS Code debugging

#### Setup

Create the following configuration file in your project to setup debugging in VS Code:

`.vscode/launch.json`
```json5
{
    "version": "0.2.0",

    "configurations": [
        /*
        Each config in this array is an option in the debug drop-down
        See below for configurations to add...
        */
    ],
}
```

#### Debugging method 1: Run tsx directly from VSCode

1. Add the following configuration to the `configurations` array in `.vscode/launch.json`:
	```json5
	{
	    "name": "tsx",
	    "type": "node",
	    "request": "launch",

	    // Debug current file in VSCode
	    "program": "${file}",

	    /*
	    Path to tsx binary
	    Assuming locally installed
	    */
	    "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/tsx",

	    /*
	    Open terminal when debugging starts (Optional)
	    Useful to see console.logs
	    */
	    "console": "integratedTerminal",
	    "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",

	    // Files to exclude from debugger (e.g. call stack)
	    "skipFiles": [
	        // Node.js internal core modules
	        "<node_internals>/**",

	        // Ignore all dependencies (optional)
	        "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/**",
	    ],
	}
	```

2. In VSCode, open the file you want to run

3. Go to VSCode's debug panel, select "tsx" in the drop down, and hit the play button (<kbd>F5</kbd>).

#### Debugging method 2: Attach to a running Node.js process

> This method works for any Node.js process and it's not specific to tsx

1. Add the following configuration to the `configurations` array in `.vscode/launch.json`:
	```json
	{
	    "name": "Attach to process",
	    "type": "node",
	    "request": "attach",
	    "port": 9229,
	    "skipFiles": [
	        // Node.js internal core modules
	        "<node_internals>/**",

	        // Ignore all dependencies (optional)
	        "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/**",
	    ],
	}
	```
2. Run tsx with `--inspect-brk` in a terminal window:

	```sh
	tsx --inspect-brk ./your-file.ts 
	```

3. Go to VSCode's debug panel, select "Attach to process" in the drop down, and hit the play button (<kbd>F5</kbd>).

## FAQ

### Why is it named _tsx_?

`tsx` stands for "TypeScript execute". Mirroring [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx), which stands for "Node.js package execute".

The 3-character package name offers an elegant developer experience, allowing usage like: `npx tsx ...`.

Unfortunately, it overlaps with React's [TSX/JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), which stands for "TypeScript XML".

### Does it type check the code it runs?

No. tsx is designed to be a simple TypeScript runner.

If you need type-checking, you can use an IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and it will type-check as you code via [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript). Alternatively, you can run the TypeScript Compiler only for type-checking (e.g. `tsc --noEmit`) as a linting step.

### How is `tsx` different from [`ts-node`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)?

`tsx` and `ts-node` are both designed for executing TypeScript files in Node.js, but offer different approaches to suit user preferences.

- **Simple installation** tsx is offered as a single binary without peer dependencies, and can be used without installation: `npx tsx ./script.ts`. In comparison, `ts-node` requires installing TypeScript or SWC as peer dependencies.

- **Zero configuration** tsx _just works_. It doesn't require initial setup or a `tsconfig.json` file, and doesn't get in the way of running your code.

- **Sensible defaults** tsx employs sensible defaults based on file imports and Node.js version, removing the need for certain `tsconfig.json` settings (that are designed for compilation rather than runtime). In comparison, ts-node relies on TypeScript's defaults (e.g. [`ES3` target](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target)), which may be outdated.

- **Module adaptability** tsx automatically adapts between CommonJS and ESM modules, even supporting `require()` of ESM modules, facilitating a smoother transition as the Node.js ecosystem evolves.

- **Enhancements** tsx gracefully handles [new JS & TS syntax](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/) and features based on the Node.js version. It also supports [`tsconfig.json` paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) out of the box.

- **Speed** tsx utilizes [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#:~:text=typescript%20benchmark) to achieve rapid TypeScript compilation. In comparison, ts-node uses the TypeScript compiler by default. Because tsx doesn't type check, it's similar to `ts-node --esm --swc` (which uses the [SWC compiler](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node#swc-1)).

- **Watcher** As a DX bonus, tsx also comes with watch mode to help you iterate faster!

For a detailed technical comparison, you can refer to this [exhaustive comparison](https://github.com/privatenumber/ts-runtime-comparison) between `tsx`, `ts-node`, and other runtimes.

### Does it have a configuration file?

No. tsx's integration with Node.js is designed to be simple & seamless. However, it supports a few properties from `tsconfig.json` to determine how to compile TypeScript files.

### Does it have any limitations?

TypeScript & ESM transformations are handled by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), so it shares the same limitations such as:

- Compatibility with code executed via `eval()` is not preserved
- Only [certain `tsconfig.json` properties](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#tsconfig-json) are supported
- [`emitDecoratorMetadata`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata) is not supported 

For details, refer to esbuild's [JavaScript caveats](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#javascript-caveats) and [TypeScript caveats](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript-caveats) documentation.
