## About
`tsx` is a CLI command (alternative to `node`) for seamlessly running TypeScript & ESM in both `commonjs` & `module` package types.

This is for you if you ever wanted:
- A command that can _just run_ TypeScript code without dealing with configuration
- Better interoperability in codebases that use ESM and CJS dependencies
- Something really fast it's unnoticeable!

### Quick start
Try tsx now without setup! Just pass in a TypeScript file:

```sh
npx tsx ./script.ts
```

### Mission
1. Enhance Node.js with TypeScript support
2. Improve ESM <-> CJS interoperability as the ecosystem migrates to ESM
3. Support the [LTS versions of Node.js](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)


## Install

### Local installation
If you're using it in an npm project, install it as a development dependency:
```sh
npm install --save-dev tsx
```

Then you can reference it directly in the `package.json#scripts` object (you don't need npx here):
```json5
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "tsx ..."
    }
}
```

To use the binary, you can call it with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) while in the project directory:

```sh
npx tsx ...
```

### Global installation

If you want to use it in any arbitrary project without [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx), install it globally:

```sh
npm install --global tsx
```

Then, you can call `tsx` directly:

```sh
tsx ...
```

## Usage

### tsx is a Node.js wrapper

_tsx_ wraps around Node.js to enhance it with TypeScript support. Because it's a drop-in replacement for `node`, it supports all [Node.js command-line flags](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html).

```sh
# --no-warnings is a Node.js flag
tsx --no-warnings ./file.ts
```

### Run TypeScript / ESM / CJS module

Pass in a file to run:

```sh
tsx ./file.ts
```

#### Custom `tsconfig.json` path
By default, `tsconfig.json` will be detected from the current working directory.

To set a custom path, use the `--tsconfig` flag:

```sh
tsx --tsconfig ./path/to/tsconfig.custom.json ./file.ts
```

Alternatively, use the `TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH` environment variable:

```sh
TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH=./path/to/tsconfig.custom.json tsx ./file.ts
```

### Watch mode
Run file and automatically rerun on changes:

```sh
tsx watch ./file.ts
```

All imported files are watched except from the following directories:
`node_modules`, `bower_components`, `vendor`, `dist`, and `.*` (hidden directories).

#### Ignore files from watch

To exclude files from being watched, pass in a path or glob to the `--ignore` flag:
```sh
tsx watch --ignore ./ignore-me.js --ignore ./ignore-me-too.js ./file.ts
```

#### Tips
- Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to manually rerun
- Pass in `--clear-screen=false` to disable clearing the screen on rerun

### REPL
Start a TypeScript REPL by running with no arguments:

```sh
tsx
```

### Cache
Modules transformations are cached in the system cache directory ([`TMPDIR`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPDIR)). Transforms are cached by content hash, so duplicate dependencies are not re-transformed.

Set the `--no-cache` flag to disable the cache:

```sh
tsx --no-cache ./file.ts
```

Alternatively, use the `TSX_DISABLE_CACHE` environment variable:

```sh
TSX_DISABLE_CACHE=1 tsx ./file.ts
```

### Node.js Loader

`tsx` is a standalone binary designed to be used in place of `node`, but sometimes you'll want to use `node` directly. For example, when adding TypeScript & ESM support to npm-installed binaries.

To use `tsx` as a  Node.js loader, pass it in to the [`--import`](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#enabling) flag. This will add TypeScript & ESM support for both Module and CommonJS contexts.

```sh
node --import tsx ./file.ts
```

Or as an environment variable:
```sh
NODE_OPTIONS='--import tsx' node ./file.ts
```

> **Note:** The loader is limited to adding support for loading TypeScript/ESM files. CLI features such as _watch mode_ or suppressing "experimental feature" warnings will not be available.

#### ESM only loader

If you only need to add TypeScript support in a Module context, you can use the ESM loader:

##### Node.js v20.6.0 and above
```sh
node --import tsx/esm ./file.ts
```

##### Node.js v20.5.1 and below

```sh
node --loader tsx/esm ./file.ts
```

#### CommonJS only loader
If you only need to add TypeScript & ESM support in a CommonJS context, you can use the CJS loader:

```sh
node --require tsx/cjs ./file.ts
```

### Hashbang

If you prefer to write scripts that doesn't need to be passed into tsx, you can declare it in the [hashbang](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang).

Simply add `#!/usr/bin/env tsx` at the top of your file:

_file.ts_
```ts
#!/usr/bin/env tsx

console.log('argv:', process.argv.slice(2))
```

And make the file executable:
```sh
chmod +x ./file.ts
```

Now, you can run the file without passing it into tsx:
```sh
$ ./file.ts hello
argv: [ 'hello' ]
```

### VS Code debugging

#### Setup

Create the following configuration file in your project to setup debugging in VS Code:

`.vscode/launch.json`
```json5
{
    "version": "0.2.0",

    "configurations": [
        /*
        Each config in this array is an option in the debug drop-down
        See below for configurations to add...
        */
    ],
}
```

#### Debugging method 1: Run tsx directly from VSCode

1. Add the following configuration to the `configurations` array in `.vscode/launch.json`:
	```json5
	{
	    "name": "tsx",
	    "type": "node",
	    "request": "launch",

	    // Debug current file in VSCode
	    "program": "${file}",

	    /*
	    Path to tsx binary
	    Assuming locally installed
	    */
	    "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/tsx",

	    /*
	    Open terminal when debugging starts (Optional)
	    Useful to see console.logs
	    */
	    "console": "integratedTerminal",
	    "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",

	    // Files to exclude from debugger (e.g. call stack)
	    "skipFiles": [
	        // Node.js internal core modules
	        "<node_internals>/**",

	        // Ignore all dependencies (optional)
	        "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/**",
	    ],
	}
	```

2. In VSCode, open the file you want to run

3. Go to VSCode's debug panel, select "tsx" in the drop down, and hit the play button (<kbd>F5</kbd>).

#### Debugging method 2: Attach to a running Node.js process

> This method works for any Node.js process and it's not specific to tsx

1. Add the following configuration to the `configurations` array in `.vscode/launch.json`:
	```json
	{
	    "name": "Attach to process",
	    "type": "node",
	    "request": "attach",
	    "port": 9229,
	    "skipFiles": [
	        // Node.js internal core modules
	        "<node_internals>/**",

	        // Ignore all dependencies (optional)
	        "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/**",
	    ],
	}
	```
2. Run tsx with `--inspect-brk` in a terminal window:

	```sh
	tsx --inspect-brk ./your-file.ts 
	```

3. Go to VSCode's debug panel, select "Attach to process" in the drop down, and hit the play button (<kbd>F5</kbd>).

See the [VSCode documentation on _Launch Configuration_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configuration) for more information.

I'm well equppied to assist you with this project and would be happy to help you out! ðŸ™‚

## FAQ

### Why is it named `tsx`?

`tsx` stands for "TypeScript execute". Mirroring [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx), which stands for "Node.js package execute".

The 3-character package name offers an elegant developer experience, allowing usage like: `npx tsx ...`.

Unfortunately, it overlaps with React's [TSX/JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), which stands for "TypeScript XML".

### Does it do type-checking?

No, [esbuild does not support type checking](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#:~:text=TypeScript%20type%20checking%20(just%20run%20tsc%20separately)).

It's recommended to run TypeScript separately as a command (`tsc --noEmit`) or via [IDE IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript).


### How is `tsx` different from [`ts-node`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)?

They're both tools to run TypeScript files. But tsx does a lot more to improve the experience of using Node.js.

tsx _just works_. It's zero-config and doesn't require `tsconfig.json` to get started, making it easy for users that just want to run TypeScript code and not get caught up in the configuration.

It's a single binary with no peer-dependencies (e.g. TypeScript or esbuild), so there is no setup necessary, enabling usage that is elegant and frictionless for first-time users:

```
npx tsx ./script.ts
```

tsx is zero-config because it has smart detections built in. As a runtime, it detects what's imported to make many options in `tsconfig.json` redundantâ€”which was designed for compiling matching files regardless of whether they're imported.

It seamlessly adapts between CommonJS and ESM package types by detecting how modules are loaded (`require()` or `import`) to determine how to compile them. It even adds support for `require()`ing ESM modules from CommonJS so you don't have to worry about your dependencies as the ecosystem migrates to ESM.

[Newer and unsupported syntax](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/) & features like [importing `node:` prefixes](https://2ality.com/2021/12/node-protocol-imports.html) are downgraded by detecting the Node.js version. For large TypeScript codebases, it has [`tsconfig.json paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) aliasing support out of the box.

At the core, tsx is powered by esbuild for [blazing fast TypeScript compilation](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#:~:text=typescript%20benchmark), whereas `ts-node` (by default) uses the TypeScript compiler. Because esbuild doesn't type check, `tsx` is similar to `ts-node --esm --swc` (which uses the [SWC compiler](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node#swc-1)).

As a bonus, tsx also comes with a watcher to speed up your development.

[Here's an exhaustive technical comparison](https://github.com/privatenumber/ts-runtime-comparison) between `tsx`, `ts-node`, and other runtimes.

### Can it use esbuild plugins?

No. tsx uses esbuild's [Transform API](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#transform-api), which doesn't support plugins.

### Does it have a configuration file?

No. tsx's integration with Node.js is designed to be seamless so there is no configuration.

### Does it have any limitations?

Transformations are handled by esbuild, so it shares the same limitations such as:

- Compatibility with code executed via `eval()` is not preserved
- Only [certain `tsconfig.json` properties](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#tsconfig-json) are supported
- [`emitDecoratorMetadata`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata) is not supported 

For details, refer to esbuild's [JavaScript caveats](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#javascript-caveats) and [TypeScript caveats](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript-caveats) documentation.

### Does Yarn PnP work?

In CommonJS mode, yes. But in Module/ESM mode, [Node.js version v19.6.0 and up](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v19.6.0/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V19.md#esm-leverage-loaders-when-resolving-subsequent-loaders) is required.

### There's an outdated dependency in tsxâ€”can you update?

Dependencies are typically declared with SemVer ranges to allow updates. You can use the [`npm update <package name>`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update) command to automatically update them to the latest version within the defined range.

If the dependencies are out of the specified range, it indicates a potential breaking change that requires manual review. You're welcome to submit a pull request to initiate the upgrade.
